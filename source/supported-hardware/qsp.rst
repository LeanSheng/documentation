QSP Simics Platform
-----------------------


Building SBL
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build |SPN| for Intel QSP simics platform (it is the same image as QEMU, SBL will auto detect the platform at runtime)::

    python BuildLoader.py build qemu

The output images are generated under ``Outputs/qemu/SlimBootloader.bin`` directory.

.. note:: QSP simics platform does not require stitching the |SPN| into an IFWI.
